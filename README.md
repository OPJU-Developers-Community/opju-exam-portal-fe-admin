## Folder Structure

Our project follows the Atomic Design Pattern, a methodology that helps in organizing code in a scalable and maintainable way. The structure is designed to promote reusability and readability, making it easier for developers to navigate and contribute to the project.

- `Atoms` The smallest, indivisible components of the system. Examples include buttons, input fields, and labels.

- `Molecules` Combinations of atoms that form more complex components. For instance, a form consisting of input fields, labels, and a submit button.

- `Organisms` Larger components that combine molecules and/or atoms to create distinct sections of the user interface, such as a navigation bar or a sidebar.

- `Templates` Complete structures that bring together organisms to form entire pages or layouts.

- `Pages` Instances of templates with actual content and data.

**Other folders**

- `redux`
    - `apis` API-related files.
    - `slices` Redux slices (using Redux Toolkit).
    - `rootReducer.ts` The root reducer combining all other reducers.
    - `store.ts` The Redux store configuration.
- `types` TypeScript type definitions.
- `utils` Utility functions and helper modules.
- `hoc` Higher Order Components.
